## Objects, Strings, and Arrays

**OBJECTS** :tangerine:
Write a function that takes an object representing a student's grades in various subjects and returns the average grade.

**ARRAYS** :apple:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

**STRINGS** :strawberry:
Write a function that takes a string and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Hint: use regular expression.

**INTERMEDIATE OBJECTS, ARRAYS, AND STRINGS** :banana:
You are given an array of objects representing students' information. Each object contains the student's name, age, and a list of courses they are enrolled in. Write a function that takes this array as input and returns an array of strings, where each string represents a student's information in the following format: "Name (Age): Courses". If a student is enrolled in multiple courses, list them separated by commas.
